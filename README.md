# hello-world
Base Repository for ideas and starting.

Call me Xtian, I've programmed in Python - SQL - and also some Java before, but unfortunately have been unable to hold onto that knowledge due to some health issues(I experienced a TBI in 2015 sustaining some long-term memory & brain problems. Well and better, striving to be the best I can now).

After being away from programming for 4+ months I'm diving headfirst back into it with fundementals & basics. 

I'm  getting back into with the goal of being a Full-Stack Developer, and also Cyber Security!

Goal 1: Build Python Web Apps with Flask

Agenda: re_Learn Python Fundementals -> Learn Web Development Fundementals(HTML & CSS) -> Learn Flask Framework Basic -> Build Flask App --->
       -> Learn Jinja2(Python & HTML) -> re_Learn SQL & Database Basics -> combo_Learn Databases in Flask -> Setup a Database in Flask   --->
       -> Learn ADVanced Flask(Accounts & Authentication) -> Learn & Deploy a Flask App(with Heroku) ->> Build Python Web App with Flask !

I hope to record & update my journey on this github by posting daily, consistently, and as much as possible!
